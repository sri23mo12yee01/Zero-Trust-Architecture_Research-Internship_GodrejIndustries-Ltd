# Zero-Trust-Architecture_Research-Internship_GodrejIndustries-Ltd
I had done a two month research internship at Godrej Industries Ltd. on the topic of Zero Trust Architecture and Micro-segmentation focusing on ZTNA and its principles. The main area of study was the paradigm shift to ZTNA and why it was necessary for businesses. I got to interact with industry professionals, not only from Godrej Industries Ltd, but also from ColorTokens whom Godrej was working with for their project and implementation. My task was to observe in the few meetings I was allowed, read and research more about Zero trust and associated principles and learn more about micro-segmentation and its benefits. I also had to submit a report and make a presentation at the end of my internship on the things I had learned and understood.
